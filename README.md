<h1>Achieving Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX) compliance through Industry Simulation Design and its Security controls </h1>

 ### [I am also doing Security Awareness](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100086563703368&mibextid=ZbWKwL)

 <h2>Project Descrption</h2>
Project consists of a simple PowerShell script that walks the user through "zeroing out" (wiping) any drives that are connected to the system. The utility allows you to select the target disk and choose the number of passes that are performed. The PowerShell script will configure a diskpart script file based on the user's selections and then launch Diskpart to perform the disk sanitization.
<br />

<h2>Aim and objectives of the project</h2>
Attain Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX), is always being challenge for organisations, particularly those operating in the domain of Finance. Knowing how to implement practically security controls to meet the internal control requirement of Sarbanes-Oxley is a must. This project aims to design and simulate industry-based IT intrastate through network simulation environment and implement appropriated security controls.
<br />
<h3>As objectives, the project seeks to:</h3>
<p>
•	Design an industry or Corporate network infrastructure that aligns with the requirements of SOX compliance. 
The designed network will replicate a real-world IT infrastructure and will be used to implement and test security.<br />
•	Identify the specific security controls needed to achieve SOX compliance within the designed network. This includes analysing access control mechanisms, encryption techniques<br />
•	Implement the identified security controls within the network infrastructure simulated. This involves configuring and deploying appropriate technologies.
